The Team Code Brick(TCB) is a group of architects, designers and engineers who are assembled under the era of social progress and innovation of technology, to celebrate and explore the role of new architecture and design application in trend. Events are hosted to share, spread and even pitch ideas based on internal interest and emerging technology innovation initiated at areas such as silicon valley. Untamed perspective, independent exploration and open design community are our core values. TCB originated from a balcony event with ethnic Chinese archi- tects and designers in California Bay Area, 2015. And it has evolved into a practice community with shared interests in contemporary society.

We are Codebrick@SF - a group of young professionals made of mostly architects and designers. We love thinking, discussing and sharing, quality and proactive thoughts revolving the evolution of design, with a special focus on integration of technologies into what we do:

- I draw a great picture
- I'm extremely loyal to open-minded souls
- I look forward to hearing about funny but useful ideas
